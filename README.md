Medical Software Design (Duke BME590)
=====================================

Overview
--------
Software plays a critical role in almost all medical devices, spanning device
control, feedback and algorithmic processing.  This course focuses on software
design skills that are ubiquitous in the medical device industry, including
software version control, unit testing, fault tolerance, continuous
integration testing and documentation.  Experience will be gained in both
dynamically- (Python) and statically-typed (C/C++) languages.

The course will be structured around a project to build an Internet-connected
medical device that measures and processes a biosignal, sends it to a web
server, and makes those data accessible to a web client / mobile application.
This project will be broken into several smaller projects to develop software
design fundamentals.  All project-related work will be done in groups of 3
students.

## Feature Branch Development

### Collaboration on Single Repository

### Forking Repository

### Pull Requests 

### Mission #1
For everything below, `$netid` refers to your Duke Net ID (e.g., `mlp6`), not your GitHub username.
* Fork this repository: https://github.com/mlp6/bme590s18_lecture03
* Clone your forked repository to your local computer
* Create a new branch called `$netid/myinfo`
* In your new branch, create a new file called `$netid.csv`
* Add a line to that file that contains:
```
# Firstname, Lastname, Net ID, GitHub Name, Teamname
# For example:
Mark, Palmeri, mlp6, mlp6, MetalRules
```
Your Teamname should:
  + Contain no spaces
  + Use CamelCase
* Push your working branch to your GitHub fork
* Using GitHub, submit a Pull Request to merge your branch on your forked repository back into `mlp6/bme590s18_lecture03`

# Mission #2
* Python code to concatenate all of the user data
* Write CSV / JSON

# Mission #3
* Represent data as dictionary
* Represent data as Class/Objects
* Store data in database (MongoDB / SQL)
